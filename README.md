# ALE-and-GNNs
This repository contains the code used in the experiments and analyses for my thesis on the application of Accumulated Local Effects (ALE) to Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The thesis investigates how ALE, a model-agnostic interpretability method, can be adapted to visualize the effects of node features in GNNs, with a particular focus on link prediction tasks.

Applying ALE to GNNs poses a trade off between increasing computational complexity or ignoring the disturbance coming from modified nodes' interactions during message passing.
This repository contains the code to test this effects
